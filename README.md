# web-scrapping-project-python.List-of-Mumbai-Suburban-Railway-stations.
The "Mumbai Suburban Railway Stations" web scraping project in Python aims to collect and organize data about the various railway stations in Mumbai's suburban network. 
By using libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, this project extracts information like station names, codes, and locations from online resources. 
The scraped data can then be used for analysis, mapping, or building a station directory.
